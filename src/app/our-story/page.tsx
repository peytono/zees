      <h1>Our Story</h1>
      <p>
        Originally from Maine, I started making pizza at home with my pops. It was also pops who
        introduced me to the best spots around New York, New Haven and Boston. Then in '94, we moved
        to New Orleans. In high school, my first jobs were at a few local pizza joints washing
        dishes, tossing dough, and making pies. But it was our homemade pies that really hit the
        spot. There’s just something special about a thin, crispy charred crust that can’t be beat.
        <br />
        Later in college, I used what I learned from work and friends (we miss you stikfigg) to make
        my own dough and started crankin out some pretty killer pies in my apartment. Our weekend
        pizza parties were really great for about 10 years! Most of what we do today was developed
        in our small house on Oak Street.
        <br />
        Everything changed when the pandemic hit. My camera department film job completely shut
        down, and we'd just had our baby boy Asher. I was at a crossroads. So I just started making
        pizza, ALL THE TIME. What began as just giving pies away from the side door, turned into a
        pop-up at Zony Mash. Even after film production restarted, I had gone too far. There was no
        turning back, and now Zee's is all grown up into a real pizza shop!
        <br />
        We’ve come a long way since that first batch of dough in 2010, I really hope you enjoy it.
        <br />
        Thank you, <br />
